Configuration for my keyboard.

## Some Details
I built myself a Nyquist split ortholinear keyboard. It uses the QMK firmware. The files in this repository are used for keymapping by the firmware. 

I'm typically using the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm) to compile and produce the hex file from the json file, then [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox) to flash my device (since I'm mostly on Windows).
